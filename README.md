# üß∞ Max‚Äôs Work Showcase

> üí° *‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt my company‚Äôs source code ‚Äî it‚Äôs a curated collection of sanitized examples showing how I approach infrastructure, automation, and network/systems engineering.‚Äù*

Welcome!  
This repo is my **public showcase of patterns and projects** from both my professional work and personal homelab. Think of it as a portfolio of patterns, demos, and reference implementations that reflect how I build and solve problems.  

I share these not just to highlight what I‚Äôve done, but to help others **learn faster, avoid roadblocks, and simplify their own work**.  

If something here saves you time or sparks an idea, then it‚Äôs done its job.

## üîí About These Repos

- **Sanitized for public release**  
  No secrets, sensitive configs, or internal hostnames.  
- **Reference-first**  
  These repos are *examples* of patterns, not production-ready code drops.  
- **Living portfolio**  
  I update, restructure, or retire repos as my work evolves.

## üöÄ How to Use This Showcase

- **Clone & explore**: Most repos have clear READMEs and sample configs.  
- **Steal with pride**: Copy patterns that help your own automation/infrastructure.  
- **Follow along**: I add new repos and examples as I go.
