# üß∞ Max‚Äôs Work Showcase

Welcome!  
This repo serves as an **index and landing page** for the public-facing projects I share from my professional work and personal life. 
Think of it as a portfolio: these are patterns, demos, and reference implementations that reflect how I build and solve problems.

## üîí About These Repos

- **Sanitized for public release**  
  No secrets, sensitive configs, or internal hostnames.  
- **Reference-first**  
  These repos are *examples* of patterns, not production-ready code drops.  
- **Living portfolio**  
  I update, restructure, or retire repos as my work evolves.

## üöÄ How to Use This Showcase

- **Clone & explore**: Most repos have clear READMEs and sample configs.  
- **Steal with pride**: Copy patterns that help your own automation/infrastructure.  
- **Follow along**: I add new repos and examples as I go.

## üìå Notes

- If you‚Äôre looking for something specific (e.g., Azure Terraform modules, NetBox + Vault integration, Ansible roles), check the table above.
- Want to know how I use these in real environments? See the `docs/` folder (coming soon) for writeups.
